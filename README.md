## Learn more about me

My main interests are in data science, statistics, and artificial intelligence. I’m usually studying or working on projects in these areas, trying to better understand how data and algorithms can help solve real-world problems. I've completed several courses related to these fields and often get involved in research and development projects to deepen my knowledge and experience.

These are fields that are constantly evolving, so I believe it's essential to keep learning and improving — always staying up to date with new tools, techniques, and ideas.

In addition, I really enjoy organizing workshops and classes, as well as creating educational materials to help others understand complex topics more easily. I especially engage in this kind of work at RoboLab, where I collaborate closely with the community through events and teaching initiatives.
